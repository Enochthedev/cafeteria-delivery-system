## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Node.js:** v14.x or higher
- **npm:** v6.x or higher
- **Database:** MongoDB v4.x or higher (or your preferred database)
- **Git:** Installed and configured

> :warning: **Important:** Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the application to avoid connection issues.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourorganization/collabo-backend.git
   cd collabo-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Duplicate the .env.example file and rename it to .env.
   - Fill in the required environment variables in the .env file.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

> :information_source: **Tip:** Use a .env management tool or service to securely handle your environment variables, especially in production environments.

4. **Run Migrations (If Applicable)**

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

## Configuration

Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set in the .env file. Below is a sample of essential configurations:

```properties
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/collabo
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
API_KEY=your_api_key
```

> :exclamation: **Note:** Never commit your .env file to version control. Use environment variables management practices to keep your secrets safe.

## 🔧 Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on the port specified in your .env file (default is 5000).

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, execute:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

> :warning: **Caution:** Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the production environment before building and deploying the application.

### API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is available via Postman Collection or directly in our API Docs.

## 🌱 Development

### Branching Strategy

We follow the Git Flow branching model to manage our codebase effectively. Here’s an overview of our branching strategy:

- **main Branch:**
  - Contains the production-ready code.
  - Always deployable.
- **dev Branch:**
  - Integration branch for features.
  - Reflects the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
- **Feature Branches:**
  - Naming Convention: feature/your-feature-name
  - Purpose: Develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release.
- **Bugfix Branches:**
  - Naming Convention: bugfix/your-bugfix-name
  - Purpose: Fix bugs in the develop branch.
- **Release Branches:**
  - Naming Convention: release/x.x.x
  - Purpose: Prepare for a new production release.
- **Hotfix Branches:**
  - Naming Convention: hotfix/x.x.x
  - Purpose: Quickly patch production releases.

> :information_source: **Tip:** Always create feature branches from develop and ensure that the develop branch is up to date before starting new work.

### Running Tests

We use Jest for testing. To run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

> :warning: **Important:** Ensure that all tests pass before merging any pull requests to maintain code quality and stability.

### Linting and Formatting

We enforce code quality using ESLint and Prettier.

- **Lint the Codebase:**

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Fix Linting Errors:**

  ```bash
  npm run lint:fix
  ```

- **Format the Codebase:**

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

> :exclamation: **Note:** Adhering to linting and formatting rules helps maintain a consistent code style across the project.
